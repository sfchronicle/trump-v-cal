Health Care,"<div class='p_interactive'>The president-elect wants Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act immediately and offer a replacement plan “very quickly.” Neither he nor congressional Republicans have offered a clear vision for replacement legislation. Previous GOP proposals include halting federal dollars to expand state Medicaid, lifting the mandate to buy insurance, and ending subsidies that help people buy insurance on the health exchanges.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>California is one of the most successful states in expanding health care coverage for its residents under the Affordable Care Act, and stands to lose the most if it is repealed. California has made more progress than other states in lowering the percentage of its population that is uninsured — from 17 percent to 9 percent between 2013 and 2015. The state’s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, has added 3.8 million people since January 2014, and 1.4 million people are enrolled in health plans through Covered California, the state’s insurance marketplace.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>People with insurance through Covered California and Medi-Cal should not see their coverage disrupted in 2017. But what happens afterward remains unclear. “I don’t see Covered California being able to function without the federal money,” said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “The federal dollars in the ACA make coverage more affordable for people and bring healthy people into the market. So the federal dollars keep the market stable and have enabled people to get insurance through Covered California.” If Republicans end federal funding for Medicaid expansion, Medi-Cal could lose $17 billion, a sixth of the program’s $100 billion budget, health care advocates estimate.</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12187051/3/2000x1000.jpg,"Nurse practitioner Vanessa Mayen checks on Katherine Francis of Oakland during an appointment at Life Long West Berkeley Family Practice.",Lea Suzuki,The Chronicle,Catherine Ho,cho@sfchronicle.com,Cat__Ho,healthcare
Environment,"<div class='p_interactive'>Trump has said he favors clean air and clean water, but has nominated several Cabinet officers viewed with skepticism by environmentalists. They include former Exxon-Mobil chief Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, and, at the Environmental Protection Agency, former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who sued the agency over regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration and Congress would have the power, if they chose, to weaken or abandon the Endangered Species Act and remove environmental protections for habitats.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>California has the most ambitious climate regulations of any state, requiring a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. California also has burgeoning electric vehicle, battery and renewable fuel industries that add economic momentum toward reaching that goal. The state also has stronger protections than the U.S. for wildlife and their habitat — it bans lead bullets in hunting, for example, and outlaws coyote-killing contests and commercial trapping of bobcats.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>States have explicit authority to exceed federal environmental standards, said William Buzbee, a law professor at Georgetown University. “The fact that the proposed administrator for the EPA is likely to try to roll back climate progress doesn’t mean it happens automatically,” Buzbee said. “He would have to make the case based on law and science.” But California stands to lose a vital federal partner in its climate goals. Stanford University law Professor Michael Wara said the Trump administration may try to roll back strict new auto fuel-efficiency standards. If California wants to pursue stricter rules, as it traditionally has done on auto emissions, the state would have to ask the EPA for a waiver, leading to potential conflict with the administration. Environmental groups have repeatedly turned to the courts to strengthen wildlife protections and would probably return to the legal system if the U.S. attempts to weaken protections.</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12188214/3/2000x1000.jpg,Traffic on Highway 101 in Los Angeles.,Al Seib,Los Angeles Times,Carolyn Lochhead,clochhead@sfchronicle.com,carolynlochhead,environment
Immigration,"<div class='p_interactive'>He plans to repeal President Obama’s executive order granting a reprieve from deportation to nearly 750,000 immigrants who entered the United States illegally before age 16. He has said he would cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with immigration agents. He plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico and says Mexico will pay for it. And he has discussed restricting the distribution of H-1B visas for high-skilled foreign workers, widely used in Silicon Valley.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>The state pays for legal representation for children who entered the U.S. unaccompanied by adults. Newly introduced state legislation would fund legal representation for adult immigrants challenging deportation. State law makes driver’s licenses and in-state tuition at public colleges available to California residents regardless of immigration status. Many California cities, including San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and San Jose, have some type of sanctuary policy. The state law also prevents local governments from holding immigrants in jail for immigration agents. Construction projects in the state, including border walls, must comply with state environmental laws.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>Although immigration is governed by federal laws, state and local governments have some power “to protect immigrants in the Trump years,” said Stanford law Professor Jayashri Srikantiah. She said California could limit large-scale deportations by paying for legal representation and limiting cooperation with federal agents. Another immigration expert, Bill Ong Hing of the University of San Francisco, said state environmental laws were used a decade ago to slow construction of a border barrier in Texas and could be invoked again in California. Both agreed there’s not much the state can do to preserve H-1B visas, other than to lobby Congress.</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12188236/3/2000x1000.jpg,"Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg arrives at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 19, 2013, to discuss immigration issues.",Andrew Harrer,Bloomberg,Bob Egelko,begelko@sfchronicle.com,egelko,immigration
Education,"<div class='p_interactive'>Trump has called for redirecting $20 billion in federal dollars immediately toward creating programs that promote private-school vouchers and school choice to give parents alternatives to assigned public schools. He has not said where that money would come from, only that states would have to create alternative programs, such as magnet and charter schools, to get the dollars. Trump’s first step toward those goals was nominating charter school advocate and billionaire donor Betsy DeVos to be education secretary.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>California’s powerful teachers union has fought the charter school movement, and it has a Legislature controlled by a supermajority of Democratic lawmakers who are union-friendly and not likely to approve public vouchers for students to attend private schools.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>If the new $20 billion pot takes money away from existing education programs, it could result in less money for schools in states like California that don’t offer vouchers or a robust charter school system. California public schools are expected to receive $7.5 billion in federal funds in fiscal 2017-18. Trump can’t eliminate the Common Core education standards initiative, as he has said he would like to do, because states have control over their academic standards. He could, however, borrow a tactic from the Obama administration, which enticed states to adopt the more rigorous Common Core standards by offering more federal funding. Trump, in turn, could offer federal funding for states to scrap the standards.</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12188219/3/2000x1000.jpg,"Harvard University's Naomi Oreskes speaks as scientists, in town for American Geophysical Union's fall meeting, rally for increased vigilance to defend climate science on Dec. 16.",Scott Strazzante,The Chronicle,Melody Gutierrez,mgutierrez@sfchronicle.com,MelodyGutierrez,education
Gun Control,"<div class='p_interactive'>The president-elect has said governments have no business restricting types of guns that law-abiding citizens can own. He has also called for a national right-to-carry law that would allow gun owners with permits to carry a concealed weapon in one state to carry those firearms legally into any state.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>California has the strictest gun laws in the country, banning a long list of specific assault weapons from being sold or purchased in the state. California law gives county sheriffs and city police chiefs broad discretion when issuing concealed weapons permits.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>States can enact stricter gun laws than the federal government, but not if Congress passes a law specifically banning those restrictions, said Erwin Chemerinsky, founding dean of the UC Irvine School of Law. “Whenever Congress acts, it has to point to some power in the Constitution,” he said. If Congress wants to override states’ bans on certain firearms, it would likely point to the power to regulate commerce between states, Chemerinsky said. He said Congress could create a national concealed-carry law claiming the same power to regulate commerce, but he said he wasn’t sure it would withstand a legal challenge. UCLA law Professor Adam Winkler, an expert in constitutional law and Second Amendment rights, said, “We are likely to see legal challenges brought by California against new federal policies on guns.”</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12188211/3/2000x1000.jpg,"Todd Settergren shows off firearms at Setterarms Gun Shop in Walnut Creek.",Michael Macor,The Chronicle,Melody Gutierrez,mgutierrez@sfchronicle.com,MelodyGutierrez,guncontrol
Transportation,"<div class='p_interactive'>Trump pushes an “America’s Infrastructure First” policy that promises big investments in transportation but offers few details. The president-elect has spoken about the need to modernize rail systems and airports and repair crumbling highways. He said he wants to attract private investment to help pay for the work to avoid raising the federal deficit.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>California has big needs. Highways need repairing, and rail systems, like Caltrain, need modernization along with airports and ports. It also needs to finish construction of the nation’s first high-speed rail system.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>A big test looms in March when Caltrain hopes to win a federal guarantee of $647 million in funding to electrify the commuter railroad that links San Francisco and Silicon Valley. “We’re going to find out quickly whether supporting a project in the San Francisco Bay Area is going to be something the Trump administration will do,” said John Goodwin, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regional transportation planning and financing agency. Although Trump is expected to try a private-industry partnership to fund transportation projects, those types of arrangements usually work for things like airports and ports, not mass transit and transportation systems. “Could you rebuild La Guardia airport with private investment? Probably,” said Randy Rentschler, an MTC spokesman. “Can you relieve congestion in the Bay Area? No. Can you help BART? No. Ferries? No.” What California needs, he said, is federal grants of public funds for public projects.</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12185468/3/2000x1000.jpg,"A northbound Caltrain express train approaches the Bayshore station.",Paul Chinn,The Chronicle,Michael Cabanatuan,mcabanatuan@sfchronicle.com,ctuan,transportation
Labor rights,"<div class='p_interactive'>It’s hard to be sure. On the federal minimum wage alone, he opposed raising it from the current $7.50 an hour, called for boosting it to $10, and suggested dropping it altogether and letting each state set its own mark. Pick one. But Trump has played hardball with labor at some of his hotels, has been quick to pick fights with union leaders and said he might be willing to roll back an Obama administration rule allowing low-paid managers to collect overtime. His proposed labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, is CEO of a fast-food giant opposed to minimum wage boosts, and Trump gets two appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, which will give it a GOP majority.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>A law Gov. Jerry Brown signed last year boosted the minimum wage for larger businesses to $10.50 this year and, in stages, to $15 by 2022. Most public school teachers and government workers are unionized.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>Trump can’t overturn California’s minimum wage, but that doesn’t mean federal rules won’t have an effect, said Raymond Hogler, a professor of management at Colorado State University. A lower federal minimum wage “causes ripples in the economy, with maybe some employers looking to move to lower-wage states,” where the federal minimum is law, he said. And while California, with its labor-friendly Legislature, isn’t going to enact an antiunion right-to-work law as an increasing number of states are doing, “a national right-to-work bill gets introduced in Congress every year,” Hogler said. “One of these days there’s going to be enough support to pass it, and with Republicans in charge, maybe it’s this year.”</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12188252/3/2000x1000.jpg,"Samuel Barron leads a chant as thousands of fast-food workers and their supporters march down Bancroft Avenue in Berkeley on April 15, 2015.",Michael Macor,The Chronicle,John Wildermuth,jwildermuth@sfchronicle.com,jfwildermuth,labor
Energy,"<div class='p_interactive'>Trump has promised to rescue the dwindling coal industry and also wants increased oil and gas drilling, making the U.S. independent of foreign oil supplies. He has pledged to back out of last year’s Paris climate accord and scuttle President Obama’s Clean Power Plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>California gets just 6 percent of its electricity from coal, and state regulations effectively forbid utilities from signing new contracts with coal-fired plants. Similarly, California’s target of 50 percent renewable power by 2030 is enshrined in state law. California is home to much of the U.S. solar industry, which has benefited from the state’s climate-change laws and stood to gain business nationwide under the 2015 Clean Power Plan. The state also has 15.2 million acres of land under federal management, and some of that land contains oil. Offshore oil reserves in federal waters along the Southern California coast have been tapped for decades, but opposition from the state and its federal representatives has prevented expansion.</div>","<div class='p_interactive'>Trump could open more federal land in California to oil and gas drilling, although the process takes time and would be hampered by relatively low oil prices. He could also reopen federal waters off the coast to new oil exploration and drilling, but only with a fight. To prevent such a move, Gov. Jerry Brown last month urged President Obama to impose a permanent ban on drilling off the California coast, but Obama has not acted on the request. “California has been careful to make sure our leadership is rooted in strong state legislation,” said Laura Wisland, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “On the electricity side, there isn’t much a Trump administration could change.”</div>",http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/54/11/64/12188247/3/2000x1000.jpg,"SunRun's Brandon Anderson and Will LaRocque prepare to install one of 28 Q-Cell panels on a Sunnyvale home.",Michael Noble Jr.,The Chronicle,David R.
